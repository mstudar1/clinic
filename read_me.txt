## Problematic/Unfinished Areas
While there are likely some bugs here and there, we feel the basic functionality is all there.  We have plenty we want to do with the application which hopefully we can make happen in the remaining time. One issue in particular that we ran out of time before implementing was to wrap DAL methods that talk to multiple tables in a transaction.  That will be implemented right off the bat as we move into Iteration #2. We also plan to get out styling a bit more uniform across the tabs and forms.
